## About Me

Computer engineer in training with hands-on experience in IoT, embedded systems, and connecting devices, sensors, and cloud services. I learn by doing — building prototypes, drivers, and end-to-end integrations that bridge hardware and software in real environments.

I work with ESP32/ESP8266, Raspberry Pi as an edge gateway, and communication protocols such as MQTT and WebSockets. I also have exposure to **OPC UA**, **Asset Administration Shell (AAS)**, **digital twin concepts**, and **RAMI 4.0**, mainly through integration tasks, data mapping, and experimentation in industrial and research projects.

I also develop Android applications (Kotlin – MVVM) and cloud pipelines using AWS services such as **Lambda**, **S3**, **API Gateway**, and **Rekognition**, combining edge and cloud to process and deliver real-time insights.

I enjoy projects involving automation, sensors, data flows, and prototyping. I learn by experimenting, testing, and understanding how each part of the architecture behaves. Each project helps me grow toward building more robust, scalable, and intelligent systems.

## Research & Interests

My interests are focused on connecting the physical and digital worlds through IoT, embedded systems, and early-stage cyber-physical integrations. I explore how devices, sensors, cloud services, and industrial standards can work together to build smarter and more reliable systems.

Areas I’m currently studying and experimenting with:

- **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)** applied to real environments  
- **IoT architectures** combining microcontrollers, edge gateways, and cloud processing  
- **Edge computing** with Raspberry Pi for data aggregation and local decision-making  
- **Industrial interoperability**, including:  
  - **OPC UA** for structured industrial communication  
  - **Asset Administration Shell (AAS)** for digital representations of devices  
  - **RAMI 4.0** concepts related to integration and data layers  
- **Digital twin experimentation**, data mapping, and synchronization of device data  
- **Embedded development** with ESP32/ESP8266  
- **Cloud pipelines** using AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, Rekognition)  
- **Mobile applications** that integrate IoT or cloud processing  
- **Prototyping & experimentation** as the primary method for learning complex architectures  

I’m especially motivated by projects where hardware, software, and cloud services converge — environments that require creativity, testing, and practical problem-solving to make systems communicate effectively.
